# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

# Overview
[Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) takes you to learn the key skills needed to perform well as a machnine learning engineer.

This degree covers:

* Test Python code and build a Python package of their own.
* Build predictive models using a variety of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.
* Use Amazon SageMaker to deploy machine learning models to production environments, such as a web application or piece of hardware..
*  A/B test two different deployed models and evaluate their performance.
* Utilize an API to deploy a model to a website such that it responds to user input, dynamically.
* Update a deployed model, in response to changes in the underlying data source.

## Content

* Build a Python Package: Write a Python package on your own using software engineering best practices for writing production level code. This project is optional and will not be graded.

* Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model: Using SageMaker, deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model, which is trained to recognize the sentiment of movie reviews (positive or negative).

* Plagiarism Detector: Engineer features that can help identify cases of plagiarism in text and deploy a trained plagiarism detection model using Amazon SageMaker.

* Capstone Project & Proposal: Complete a final project—choosing from a few, provided options or a project of your own design—that involves data exploration and machine learning.
